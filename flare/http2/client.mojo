"""HTTP/2 client byte driver (RFC 9113).

Cleartext (h2c) and TLS (h2) client-side counterpart to
:class:`flare.http2.server.Http2Connection`.

This module exposes the *low-level* HTTP/2 client byte driver
that :class:`flare.http.HttpClient` uses internally when it
needs to speak HTTP/2 (either via TLS+ALPN ``h2`` for
``https://`` URLs, or via cleartext prior knowledge when the
caller passes ``prefer_h2c=True``). Application code should
go through :class:`flare.http.HttpClient`; the driver is kept
public for callers who want to roll their own dispatch loop.

- :class:`Http2ClientConfig` -- client-advertised SETTINGS
  values (mirrors :class:`flare.http2.server.Http2Config`).
- :class:`Http2ClientConnection` -- the stateful,
  *socket-agnostic* driver. The caller pumps inbound bytes
  into ``feed`` and pulls outbound bytes from ``drain``;
  per-stream completion is observed via
  ``response_ready(sid)`` / ``take_response(sid)``. Same
  shape as :class:`flare.http2.server.Http2Connection` so the
  two drivers can be paired entirely in-memory in tests.

Wire-protocol scope:

* RFC 9113 §3.5 client connection preface
  (``"PRI * HTTP/2.0\\r\\n\\r\\nSM\\r\\n\\r\\n"``) emitted first.
* RFC 9113 §6.5 SETTINGS exchange: client emits its initial
  SETTINGS frame after the preface; ACKs every server SETTINGS
  it observes; honors peer-advertised
  ``SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE`` /
  ``SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE`` /
  ``SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE``.
* RFC 9113 §5.1 client stream IDs: odd integers starting at 1,
  monotonically increasing per connection.
* RFC 9113 §6.2 / §6.10 HEADERS + CONTINUATION send and recv
  via :class:`flare.http2.hpack.HpackEncoder` /
  :class:`flare.http2.hpack.HpackDecoder` (shared with the server).
* RFC 9113 §6.1 DATA send and recv with per-stream + connection
  flow-control accounting; we eagerly emit
  ``WINDOW_UPDATE`` for received DATA so default-sized responses
  do not stall (same shape as the server-side driver).
* RFC 9113 §6.7 PING: we ACK every non-ACK PING the peer sends
  and ignore the ACK side.
* RFC 9113 §6.8 GOAWAY: we surface the received flag via
  :attr:`Http2ClientConnection.goaway_received`; in-flight
  streams below the announced last-stream-id continue normally;
  callers SHOULD stop opening new streams.
* RFC 9113 §6.4 RST_STREAM: when received, the affected stream
  is marked closed with the peer's error code stashed for the
  caller to read via :meth:`Http2ClientConnection.stream_error`.

Out of scope (intentional, mirrors the server's scope):

* Server push (``PUSH_PROMISE``) -- we never originate it and
  reject inbound PUSH_PROMISE frames from servers via
  RST_STREAM (PROTOCOL_ERROR) since flare clients do not opt
  into the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH affordance.
* Stream priority (deprecated by RFC 9113 §5.3.2).
* Trailers (HEADERS frames *after* the response DATA stream
  closes) -- accepted at the parser level but not surfaced
  through the high-level :class:`Http2Client` API.

The wire-codec / HPACK / frame-state machinery is shared with
the server (via :class:`flare.http2.state.Connection`); only the
client-specific behaviour (preface, odd stream ids, client
stream-state transitions, the high-level request/response
plumbing) lives here.

struct Http2ClientConnection(Defaultable, Movable):
    """Stateful, socket-agnostic HTTP/2 client driver.

    A pure state object -- the caller owns I/O. The lifecycle is:

    1. Construct via :meth:`__init__` or
       :meth:`with_config`. The constructor pre-queues the
       client connection preface
       (``"PRI * HTTP/2.0\\r\\n\\r\\nSM\\r\\n\\r\\n"``) plus the
       initial SETTINGS frame, ready to be drained.

    2. Call :meth:`drain` once to pull the preface + initial
       SETTINGS bytes; write them onto the socket.

    3. For each request:

       a. Allocate a stream id via :meth:`next_stream_id` (odd
          integers starting at 1).
       b. Call :meth:`send_request(sid, ...)` to enqueue the
          HEADERS frame (with optional CONTINUATION) and any
          DATA frames bounded by current flow-control windows.
          DATA that exceeds the window is held back; the
          driver releases more on inbound WINDOW_UPDATE.
       c. Call :meth:`drain` to pull outbound bytes; write them.

    4. On the inbound side: call :meth:`feed(bytes)` with bytes
       read from the socket. Internally the driver:

       - decodes frames via :func:`parse_frame`
       - dispatches them through :meth:`Connection.handle_frame`
         (with ``is_client = True`` so HEADERS / DATA receipt
         transitions HALF_CLOSED_LOCAL streams to CLOSED instead
         of HALF_CLOSED_REMOTE)
       - ACKs SETTINGS / PING as appropriate
       - emits WINDOW_UPDATE for received DATA
       - on RST_STREAM, surfaces the error code via
         :meth:`stream_error` and marks the stream closed

       Then call :meth:`drain` again to pull any auto-emitted
       outbound bytes (SETTINGS ACK, PING ACK, WINDOW_UPDATE).

    5. Poll :meth:`response_ready(sid)`; once ``True``, call
       :meth:`take_response(sid)` to pop the
       ``(status, headers, body)`` tuple.

    6. When done, optionally send a GOAWAY via
       :meth:`send_goaway` and close the socket.

    The driver is :class:`Movable` but not :class:`Copyable`; the
    HPACK dynamic table inside :class:`Connection` is mutable
    state that must not alias across two driver instances.

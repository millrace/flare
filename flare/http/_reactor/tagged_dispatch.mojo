"""Tagged-pointer dispatch helpers for the unified HTTP/1+HTTP/2 reactor.

The packed ``(kind << TAG_SHIFT) | addr`` dict-value encoding that lets

# ── Tagged-pointer dispatch ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# All three per-conn state machines (PendingConnHandle / ConnHandle /
# Http2ConnHandle) live in a single ``conns: Dict[Int, Int]`` table where
# each value is a packed ``(kind << TAG_SHIFT) | addr`` int. Linux
# x86_64 limits user-space virtual addresses to 47 bits (canonical
# form), and macOS arm64 to 47 bits as well, so the top 17 bits of any
# real heap address are always zero -- safe to repurpose.
#
# Why a single dict instead of the three-dict shape (pending_conns +
# h1_conns + h2_conns): every reactor event paid 3× ``fd in dict``
# lookups under the three-dict shape, which cost ~3.8% steady-state
# throughput on the keep-alive plaintext benchmark vs the legacy
# HTTP/1.1-only loop. Tagged dispatch collapses that to one dict op
# plus a 1-cycle bitshift+mask -- recovers the regression in full.

fit in 47 bits on Linux x86_64 / macOS arm64; the extra slack is
deliberate)."""

"""Response serialisation helpers for the H1 reactor write path.

This module owns the byte-emitting half of the per-connection
state machine: turning a parsed :class:`flare.http.response.Response`
or a pre-encoded :class:`flare.http.static_response.StaticResponse`
into the HTTP/1.1 wire bytes that
:meth:`flare.http._reactor.conn_handle.ConnHandle.on_writable`
flushes to the socket.

Splitting the serialise-path helpers out of
:mod:`flare.http._reactor.conn_handle` keeps that module focused
on the connection state machine; the helpers here are pure
functions over the connection's ``write_buf`` and ``DateCache``
and only mutate those caller-supplied references.

The hot-path optimisations (response-side ``DateCache`` reuse,
single-allocation header skip predicates, bulk-copy body append)
match the byte-fast-path / keep-alive helpers in
:mod:`flare.http._reactor.keepalive_scan`.

"""Per-connection state machine for the reactor-backed HTTP server.

This module owns ``ConnHandle`` -- the per-connection state machine
that walks each H1 connection through ``STATE_READING`` ->
``STATE_WRITING`` -> ``STATE_CLOSING`` driven by readable / writable
/ timeout events from the reactor.

Byte-fast-path / keep-alive helpers (the ``STATE_*`` constants, the
``StepResult`` return shape, the byte-level ``Connection``-header
matchers, the HTTP/1.0 ``_wants_close`` raw-bytes scanner, the
read-buffer compaction helper, and the h2c upgrade detection
wrapper) live in :mod:`flare.http._reactor.keepalive_scan` and are
re-exported here so existing import sites in ``flare.http``,
``flare.http2``, ``flare.runtime``, the tests, and the fuzz corpus
keep working unchanged.

The five reader entry points (default, bufring, cancel-aware,
view-based, static) dispatch through a shared set of helpers
parameterised on a comptime :class:`DispatchConfig` so the H1 hot
path stays straight-line and the byte-source-step duplication that
the previous shape carried collapses into a single helper.

State transitions::

    STATE_READING ─ handler returned ─> STATE_WRITING ─ flushed ─┬─> STATE_READING (keep-alive)
                                                                └─> STATE_CLOSING (should_close)
    STATE_READING / STATE_WRITING ─ peer close / error / timeout ─> STATE_CLOSING

The sister module ``flare/http/_server_reactor_impl.mojo`` owns the
I/O-bearing pieces -- reactor entry-point loops, ``Pool[ConnHandle]``
allocation glue, io_uring buffer-ring glue -- and re-exports
every public symbol below for back-compat with existing imports
across ``flare/http/``, ``flare/http2/``, ``flare/runtime/``, tests,
and the fuzz corpus.

# TODO(2026-08-31, track-h1-dispatch): this module still exceeds the
# 600-line reactor cap (``tools/check_reactor_size.sh`` allowlists it
# for that reason). The natural seam left to extract is
# :mod:`flare.http._reactor.h1_dispatch`: the parse-and-dispatch step
# of each ``on_readable_*`` reader (minimal / view / cancel-aware /
# static), called from the thin per-handler entry point that retains
# only its trait binding. Until that lands, every entry added to the
# allowlist (this module or otherwise) MUST carry a dated TODO and a
# deadline; the lint hygiene rule in
# ``tools/check_reactor_size.sh`` enforces the policy.

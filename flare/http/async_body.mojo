"""Reactor-integrated external streaming source.

The synchronous ``ChunkSource`` (``flare.http.body``) is a *pull*: each
``next`` returns the next chunk or ``None`` for EOF. That is exactly
right for an in-process FIFO (e.g. ``SseChannel``) but it can never
*wait* -- it has no way to say "nothing yet, the bytes are coming on
another fd." A streaming proxy whose chunks arrive on a UDS / pipe /
eventfd needs that third state, or every front re-implements an epoll
loop and a hand-rolled fd->client copy.

This module adds the missing state as a small, total API:

- ``ChunkPoll`` -- a tri-state poll result. Exactly one of: a ready
  chunk, "pending, wake me on this fd", or EOF. The three states are
  constructed by named factories (``ready`` / ``pending`` / ``eof``) and
  read by predicates, so an illegal combination (a chunk *and* a wait fd)
  is unrepresentable.
- ``AsyncChunkSource`` -- the async sibling of ``ChunkSource``: one
  method, ``poll(cancel) -> ChunkPoll``. Synchronous sources keep using
  ``ChunkSource``; this is purely additive.
- ``UpstreamChunkSource`` -- the concrete impl a streaming proxy needs:
  a single framed logical stream over a non-blocking connection. It
  composes the frame codec (``FrameDemux``) for parsing and reports
  ``pending(fd)`` on EAGAIN so the reactor parks instead of busy-polling.

Composition with the typed streaming surface
--------------------------------------------

A handler drives an ``AsyncChunkSource`` with no bespoke reactor code,
no file descriptors, and no per-connection bookkeeping -- attach the
source and let the framework pump it::

    def on_open(mut self, mut conn: StreamConn) raises:
        conn.attach_upstream(UpstreamChunkSource.connect(self.worker))

    def on_upstream(mut self, mut conn: StreamConn) raises:
        conn.relay_upstream()              # drains ready chunks, EOF -> close

``attach_upstream`` takes the source (it reads the fd to watch
internally and owns the source for the connection's lifetime, closing
it on teardown), and ``relay_upstream`` is the standard drain loop:
pull ready chunks into the client with backpressure, request close on
EOF, park on pending. A front that needs custom per-chunk handling can
still drive the source directly via ``conn.upstream().poll(...)``.

The reactor calls ``on_upstream`` only when the attached fd is readable,
so the ``pending`` branch is a genuine park, not a poll loop (no
busy-poll between gaps). Watermark backpressure additionally gates the
*upstream* read interest when the client is write-blocked.

"""epoll/kqueue server reactor loops + per-connection lifecycle glue.

The ``Reactor``-backed (epoll on Linux, kqueue on macOS) server event
loops -- dynamic-handler, static-response, cancel-aware and view-aware
variants and their dedicated/shared-listener wrappers -- plus the shared
connection-lifecycle helpers (alloc/free/lookup of a ``ConnHandle``,
``_apply_step`` reactor/timer translation, ``_cleanup_conn`` teardown,
and the two accept drainers) that both the epoll and io_uring loops
build on. Split out of ``_server_reactor_impl.mojo`` to keep each module
within the file-size budget; ``_server_reactor_impl`` re-exports every
public name so existing ``from flare.http._server_reactor_impl import
run_reactor_loop ...`` (server.mojo, frontend.mojo, _unified_reactor_impl,
tests) call sites keep resolving unchanged. Pure code motion.

    Drives both :func:`run_reactor_loop_static` (dedicated listener)

    listener). The two paths differed only in (a) ``register`` vs
    ``register_exclusive`` for the listener token and (b) the
    byte-equivalent accept drainer; folding both into one
    comptime-parameterised body deletes ~120 lines of duplicate

    flush. No ``Request`` allocation, no handler call, no response
    serialisation. Combined with the shared-listener variant this is

"""Per-worker ``Response`` pool.

Holds a small stack of pre-allocated, reset-in-place ``Response``
objects so the keep-alive hot path can reuse the same struct
(plus its ``HeaderMap`` + ``body`` ``List[UInt8]`` backings)
across consecutive requests on the same connection.

Background
----------

Each ``Response.__init__`` allocates:

1. A fresh ``HeaderMap`` (two empty ``List[String]`` instances).
2. The body ``List[UInt8]`` (default-constructed; capacity 0).
3. A fresh ``reason`` String + ``version`` String.

Even with ownership-by-move responses (``var body``, no copy),
this is one struct + two lists per response. On a long-running
keep-alive connection at 220K req/s, that's ~2.2M list
allocations / s — measurable. ``ResponsePool.acquire()`` returns
a ``Response`` whose backings still carry the previous request's
capacity but are emptied via ``Response.reset(...)``, so the
next ``headers.append`` / ``body.append`` reuses the same
malloc'd backing as long as it fits.

Per-worker, not shared
-----------------------

This pool, like ``DateCache`` and ``Pool[BufferHandle]``,
is **per-worker**. There's no atomic, no mutex, no cross-thread
coordination. Each reactor worker constructs its own
``ResponsePool`` and calls ``acquire`` / ``release`` on its local
instance. Two workers handing the same FD's response cell across
a thread boundary is not a supported pattern.

Storage strategy
----------------

``Response`` is ``Movable`` but not ``Copyable``, so we can't
hold a ``List[Response]`` directly (Mojo's ``List`` requires
``Copyable``). Instead we store ``List[Int]`` where each entry
is a heap-allocated ``Response`` cell address, managed via the
existing ``flare.runtime.Pool[Response]`` typed allocator.
``acquire`` pops an address, copies the Response value out via
``Pool.get_ptr().take_pointee()``, and frees the cell.
``release`` moves the supplied Response into a fresh cell and
pushes the address. Net allocation cost: ``alloc/free`` per
acquire/release pair, but the underlying body + header List
buffers are **preserved across the move**, which is the actual
B6 win.

Wiring into the reactor's per-connection state machine
(``flare.http._server_reactor_impl.ConnHandle``) is a follow-up
commit that bolts onto this primitive without changing the
serializer's hot-path layout. The primitive exists today so
the wiring change is a mechanical swap of
``Response(status=200, ...)`` for
``response_pool.acquire(status=200, ...)``.

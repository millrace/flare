"""Reliability middleware: ``Retry`` / ``PostHocDeadline`` /
``RateLimit`` / ``CircuitBreaker`` policies.

A reliability middleware wraps an inner ``Handler`` and adds a
policy that improves the chance the call succeeds in the face of
transient failures (transient upstream 5xx, slow handlers, etc).

- :class:`Retry[Inner]` — re-invoke the inner handler when it
  raises or returns a 5xx response, up to ``max_attempts`` times.
  Caller-tunable retry set (any 5xx by default; bounded to GET /
  HEAD / OPTIONS / TRACE / PUT / DELETE -- the RFC 9110 §9.2.2
  idempotent set -- by passing ``retry_only_idempotent=True``).
  Optional exponential backoff with full jitter spaces attempts.
- :class:`PostHocDeadline[Inner]` — bound the wall-clock time the
  inner handler may consume **measured after it returns**: the
  middleware records the entry timestamp, runs the inner handler
  to completion, then compares elapsed time against the budget
  and replaces the response with a 504 if the budget was
  exceeded. **It does not preempt the inner handler** -- Mojo
  cannot preempt synchronous code (see ``flare/http/cancel.mojo``),
  so a genuinely runaway synchronous handler runs to completion on
  its worker; reactor-enforced cancellation exists only at the
  peer-FIN, shutdown, and streaming-edge boundaries, not inside a
  synchronous handler body. This is the K2 model limit.
- :class:`RateLimit[Inner]` — token-bucket admission control:
  reject with ``429 Too Many Requests`` once the per-second rate
  (with burst) is exceeded. State is a leaked, atomic heap cell
  shared across worker copies (ponytail: process-lifetime leak of
  one small cell per middleware instance; the atomics keep it
  race-free, so N workers enforce an approximate shared rate).
- :class:`CircuitBreaker[Inner]` — trip to ``503`` after
  ``failure_threshold`` consecutive failures (5xx or raise), then
  fast-fail for ``cooldown_ms`` before letting one probe through.
  Same leaked-atomic-cell state model as ``RateLimit``.

Each middleware is generic over its inner ``Handler`` so the
chain stays monomorphised -- no virtual dispatch.

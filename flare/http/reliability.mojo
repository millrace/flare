"""Reliability middleware: ``Retry`` + ``PostHocDeadline`` policies.

A reliability middleware wraps an inner ``Handler`` and adds a
policy that improves the chance the call succeeds in the face of
transient failures (transient upstream 5xx, slow handlers, etc).

This commit ships two policies; the matching ``RateLimit`` and
``CircuitBreaker`` policies follow in subsequent commits within
this cycle.

- :class:`Retry[Inner]` — re-invoke the inner handler when it
  raises or returns a 5xx response, up to ``max_attempts`` times.
  Caller-tunable retry set (any 5xx by default; bounded to GET /
  HEAD / OPTIONS / TRACE / PUT / DELETE -- the RFC 9110 §9.2.2
  idempotent set -- by passing ``retry_only_idempotent=True``).
  Optional exponential backoff with full jitter spaces attempts.
- :class:`PostHocDeadline[Inner]` — bound the wall-clock time the
  inner handler may consume **measured after it returns**: the
  middleware records the entry timestamp, runs the inner handler
  to completion, then compares elapsed time against the budget
  and replaces the response with a 504 if the budget was
  exceeded. **It does not preempt the inner handler.** That
  reactor-cooperative cancel-cell flip lands in a later commit;
  until then this primitive is enough for handlers that complete
  promptly (cleanup that must observe the deadline drift through
  the inner handler return path).

Each middleware is generic over its inner ``Handler`` so the
chain stays monomorphised -- no virtual dispatch.

    - ``max_attempts``: total number of inner-handler invocations
      (so ``max_attempts=3`` means 1 initial + 2 retries).
    - ``retry_only_idempotent``: when True, retries are gated on
      the request method being one of GET / HEAD / OPTIONS / TRACE
      / PUT / DELETE (the RFC 9110 §9.2.2 idempotent set). When
      False, every 5xx triggers a retry regardless of method.
    - ``initial_backoff_ms``: when > 0, sleep this many milliseconds
      before retry attempt #2. Each subsequent attempt scales the
      backoff by ``backoff_multiplier`` (capped at
      ``max_backoff_ms``). The actual sleep is "full jitter" --
      a uniform random draw in ``[0, capped_backoff_ms]`` -- which
      is the AWS-recommended default for retry storms (see
      <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/>).
      ``0`` (the default) disables sleeps and matches the previous
      "tight loop" behaviour.
    - ``backoff_multiplier``: per-attempt scaling factor. Defaults
      to ``2`` (binary exponential backoff: 100ms -> 200ms ->
      400ms -> ...).
    - ``max_backoff_ms``: cap on the un-jittered backoff before
      ``random_ui64`` draws the actual sleep. Defaults to
      ``2_000`` (2 s); set to a small value to keep tail latency
      bounded.

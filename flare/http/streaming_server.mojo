"""Typed streaming-handler surface.

A custom multiplexing / streaming front -- the shape a streaming
proxy needs -- used to drop to the raw reactor and smuggle every live
object (the reactor, the streams, the buffers) as an ``Int`` address,
rebuilding it with ``UnsafePointer(unsafe_from_address=...)``, plus
hand-rolled ``alloc`` per-slot tables and a free list. This module
removes that: the framework owns the connection lifecycle and the
reactor; the handler is a typed struct whose fields are its shared
state and which receives a framework-owned ``StreamConn`` per event.

Pieces:

- ``StreamHandler`` -- the lifecycle trait (``on_open`` / ``on_upstream``
  / ``on_writable`` / ``on_close``). Every method takes ``mut self``
  (the typed shared state, one instance shared across all connections)
  and a ``mut`` ref to the framework-owned ``StreamConn``. No raw
  token, no address-as-``Int``.
- ``StreamConn`` -- the framework-owned per-connection handle. Owns the
  client ``TcpStream``, a per-connection ``Cancel`` cell, a stable
  per-connection id, the close flag, and a single owned outbound write
  buffer (``send`` queues; ``flush_blocking`` / ``drain_nonblocking``
  empty it). No per-slot ``alloc`` table, no free list.
- ``run_stream_connection`` -- a blocking single-connection driver that
  walks one connection through the lifecycle. The reactor-integrated
  multi-connection entry point (``HttpServer.serve_streaming``, in
  ``_stream_reactor_impl``) builds on the same trait and the same
  ``StreamConn``; this driver is the testable single-connection core
  and is itself useful for one-connection UDS sidecars.

Typed-state model
-----------------

Mojo has neither parameterized traits nor associated types,
so a single ``StreamHandler`` cannot carry a per-handler "state type
S" or "per-connection type U" in its method signatures and still let
the method *body* read those typed fields. The model that is both
typed and usable:

- **Shared state** is the handler struct's own fields. The framework
  holds one handler instance and calls it (via ``mut self``) for every
  connection and every event, so the fields are shared, mutable, and
  fully typed -- this is the shared ``ServeState`` (e.g. a persistent
  ``FrameMux``) reached as a typed ref rather than an ``Int`` address.
- **Per-connection state** for the common single-upstream relay is
  framework-owned: ``conn.attach_upstream(source)`` moves an
  ``UpstreamChunkSource`` into the ``StreamConn``, the framework pumps
  it (``relay_upstream``), and teardown closes it. The relay front then
  has *no* per-connection container at all and touches no file
  descriptor or byte ``Span``.
- **Richer per-connection state** (fan-in, several upstreams, custom
  bookkeeping) is still keyed by ``conn.id()`` in a typed container the
  handler declares once (e.g. ``Dict[Int, MyConnState]``). The
  framework assigns the id and signals ``on_open`` / ``on_close`` so
  the handler inserts / removes its entry -- no ``alloc``, no manual
  free list, lifecycle framework-owned.

Together this removes the need for a hand-rolled context of ``Int``
addresses and the ``alloc[...](max_slots)`` slot tables + free stack a
raw-reactor front would otherwise carry.

Shared middleware with the request/response path
-------------------------------------------------

``serve`` (request/response ``Handler``) and ``serve_streaming``
(event-lifecycle ``StreamHandler``) are distinct entry points, but they
share one middleware stack through ``StreamConn.send_response``: build a
single ``Handler`` stack (e.g. ``Logger[RequestId[Router]]``), run it in
``on_open`` via ``stack.serve(req)``, and frame the resulting
``Response`` onto the connection with ``conn.send_response(resp)`` before
streaming the tail with ``conn.send``. This lets one process put a REST
control plane and a token-streaming endpoint behind the same
logging / request-id / routing stack. The request/response counterpart
is ``HttpServer.serve_cancellable(WithCancel(stack^))`` -- see that
method's docstring.

        streaming front gets the exact logging / request-id / routing
        behaviour the request/response path has, and keeps
        ``conn.send(...)`` for the streamed tail (SSE tokens, relayed
        chunks). Without this a streaming front had to hand-roll its
        status line and headers as a raw string, bypassing the
        middleware stack entirely.

        ``Content-Length`` is emitted from the body length unless the
        response already declares ``Transfer-Encoding`` or
        ``Content-Length`` (chunked / SSE fronts set ``Transfer-Encoding``
        and stream the body via ``send``). ``Connection`` is always set
        from ``keep_alive`` (any inbound ``Connection`` header is
        dropped). This is HTTP/1.x framing only -- a streaming front
        speaks h1 to the client; h2/h3 response heads have their own
        framing on those paths.

        The head framing is the shared, transport-agnostic
        ``frame_h1_stream_head_into`` adapter (see
        ``flare/http/_server/write.mojo``), so an HTTPS front streaming
        over ``TlsConnHandle`` frames its head identically -- the bytes
        just ride ``SSL_write`` instead of ``send``.

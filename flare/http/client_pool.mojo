"""HTTP/1.1 client connection pool.

Idle-connection reuse for :class:`flare.http.HttpClient`. Avoids
the per-request TCP / TLS handshake when consecutive requests
target the same origin (RFC 7230 §6.3 keep-alive semantics on the
client side).

The pool is keyed on ``(scheme, host, port)`` -- one idle deque
per origin. ``acquire(key)`` pops the most recently inserted fd
(LIFO so the warmest TCP / TLS state is reused first); ``release``
pushes the fd back onto the deque if there's room; otherwise the
fd is closed. A first read on a freshly-acquired fd that returns
0 (peer closed the keep-alive idly) signals stale, and the caller
retries on a fresh connection (RFC 7230 §6.3.1).

Scope -- the pool is deliberately kept small:

* Plain TCP (``http://``) only. ``https://`` requests still
  full-handshake every time; the TLS resumption work in
  ``flare/tls/`` (Commit 04) lets that handshake be much cheaper,
  and a follow-up commit ties the pool key to the negotiated ALPN
  + the TLS session ticket fingerprint so reusable TLS
  connections land in the same bucket.
* No background eviction thread -- idle entries are evicted
  lazily on the next ``acquire(key)`` if their wallclock-age has
  exceeded :attr:`idle_timeout_ms`.
* Per-host cap (``max_idle_per_host``) and total cap
  (``max_idle_total``) bound memory; over-cap fds are closed
  immediately on release rather than queued.
* Synchronous, single-threaded -- the pool is owned by an
  ``HttpClient`` instance, and ``HttpClient`` is ``Movable`` (not
  ``Copyable``), so the pool is never shared across threads.
  Multi-worker pooling is a future addition.

The ``ClientPool`` struct itself is a thin handle holding the
heap address of an internal ``_ClientPoolState`` (mirrors the
Cancel / Pool ownership patterns used elsewhere in the codebase).
``HttpClient`` stores the address and re-materialises a typed
pointer on every access; on ``HttpClient.__del__`` the state is
freed and any remaining fds are closed.

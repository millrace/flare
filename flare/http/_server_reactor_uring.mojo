"""io_uring server reactor loops (static-response + buffer-ring handler).

The ``UringReactor``-backed server event loops: the multishot-poll
static-response twin of the epoll path (``run_uring_reactor_loop_static``)
and the production buffer-ring handler dispatch
(``run_uring_bufring_reactor_loop`` / ``_shared``) with its kernel-managed
``IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING`` substrate, generation-stamped conn-id
encoding, setup-flag probe and submit-send drivers. Split out of
``_server_reactor_impl.mojo`` to keep each module within the file-size
budget; ``_server_reactor_impl`` re-exports every public name so existing
call sites keep resolving unchanged. Pure code motion. Linux-only paths
guard themselves with a ``comptime if not is_linux(): raise``.

# ── io_uring server-loop dispatch ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# When ``use_uring_backend()`` is true (Linux kernel exposes io_uring
# AND ``FLARE_DISABLE_IO_URING`` is unset), ``HttpServer.serve_static``
# routes through ``run_uring_reactor_loop_static`` below instead of
# the epoll/kqueue ``run_reactor_loop_static`` above.
#
# How it differs from the epoll path
# -----------------------------------
#
# * Backend: ``UringReactor`` (multishot accept on the listener,
#   multishot poll per connection fd) instead of ``Reactor``
#   (epoll_wait on Linux, kqueue on macOS). One ``io_uring_enter``
#   per loop iteration replaces ``epoll_wait`` + ``epoll_ctl(MOD)``
#   per modify; the multishot accept replaces the
#   ``while True: accept(); EAGAIN`` drain loop with one CQE per
#   accepted connection.
# * Per-conn state machine: **unchanged**. ``ConnHandle.on_readable_static``
#   and ``on_writable`` still do their own non-blocking ``recv`` /
#   ``send`` on the socket fd. The uring path only replaces the
#   *readiness notifier*: the kernel posts a ``URING_OP_POLL`` CQE
#   when the fd becomes readable / writable, and the dispatch loop
#   calls the same on_readable_static / on_writable code that the
#   epoll path runs. This keeps the wire-in surgical: zero changes
#   to the parser / response framer / keep-alive logic.
# * Cleanup: closing the connection fd implicitly cancels the
#   kernel's multishot poll on it. Any final-no-more-events CQE
#   that arrives after cleanup looks like a "conn_id not in dict"
#   miss in the dispatch switch and is silently ignored.
# * Modify (read <-> write): ``cancel_poll(fd) +
#   arm_poll_readable_multishot(fd, mask)`` is the io_uring
#   equivalent of ``epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD, fd, mask)``. We
#   trigger it from ``_apply_step_uring`` only when the new
#   interest mask actually differs from the currently-armed one,
#   matching the epoll path's no-op-skip optimisation.

# ── io_uring buffer-ring dispatch (handler path) ────────────────────────────
#
# Production handler-path io_uring loop using the kernel-managed buffer
# ring substrate: ``IORING_OP_RECV`` + ``IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT`` +
# ``IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT`` against a registered buffer group (set up via
# ``IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING`` on kernels >= 5.19, or
# ``IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS`` on older).
#
# How it works
# ------------
#
# This is the same pattern every Rust io_uring HTTP server (tokio-uring,
# monoio, glommio) uses:
#
#   1. At reactor startup, allocate a per-worker buffer pool of
#      N × 8 KiB and register it as a buffer group via
#      ``register_pbuf_ring(bgid, ring_entries)``. The kernel takes
#      ownership of the buffer ring; we keep the backing allocation
#      alive (free at reactor shutdown).
#   2. On each accept CQE, arm one IORING_OP_RECV +
#      IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT + IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT SQE with
#      buf_group=bgid. The kernel auto-rotates buffers from the
#      pool for every recv on this fd; one SQE per connection
#      drives an unbounded stream of recv CQEs.
#   3. On each recv CQE, the buffer id is in the CQE's flags
#      high 16 bits (IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER set). We compute the
#      buffer's address as ``pool + bid * BUF_SIZE``, feed the
#      bytes into ConnHandle.on_readable_from_buf[H], and recycle
#      the buffer back into the pool via a shared-memory tail bump
#      (PBUF_RING) or a one-shot PROVIDE_BUFFERS SQE (older
#      kernels).
#   4. On step_done, just free the conn (close fd; kernel cancels
#      any pending recv multishot SQE). No per-conn buffer to free
#      -- the buffer was already returned to the pool in step 3
#      (or will be returned by the kernel on the next CQE).
#
# Why MULTISHOT recv requires the buffer ring: without
# ``IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT``, IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT either errors out,
# fires once and stops, or unsafely reuses the user's single buffer
# across overlapping CQEs. ``IORING_OP_POLL_ADD``'s multishot mode is
# also unsuitable because its edge-triggered semantics race against
# the recv-EAGAIN drain pattern under back-to-back keep-alive.
#
# This eliminates per-conn buffer pinning AND drops the recv
# syscall per request (the kernel hands us bytes via the buffer
# ring), which is the principal io_uring performance unlock for
# the recv-side.
#
# Send path is synchronous ``on_writable`` using non-blocking
# ``_send``. ``UringReactor.submit_send`` is exposed as substrate
# for callers that want to land kernel-async sends on top of
# this dispatch.

# trailing recv CQE in flight (the final-no-more-events CQE
# from the cancelled multishot recv) tagged with conn_id=8.
# If a new connection B is accepted on the *same* fd=8 before
# we see that stale CQE, our naive ``conn_id = fd`` scheme
# routes the stale CQE to B's freshly-armed recv state -- which
# either double-arms recv (kernel SIGSEGV territory) or feeds
# stale buffer-id data into B's parser. Generation-stamped
# conn_ids fix this: each accept bumps a per-worker monotonic
# generation counter, packs ``(gen << 24) | fd`` into the
# 56-bit conn_id space, and stores the conn under that full
# packed id. Stale CQEs from connection A carry the OLD gen
# bits and miss the ``if conn_id not in conns`` lookup --
# they're dropped cleanly, never touching connection B's

    kernel runs task work relative to the dispatch loop's
    CQE-drain rhythm. The kernel scheduler hints introduced in
    5.19 (COOP_TASKRUN + TASKRUN_FLAG + SUBMIT_ALL) and 6.0/6.1
    (SINGLE_ISSUER + DEFER_TASKRUN) batch task work to enter
    boundaries instead of running it IPI-style mid-syscall.

    Probes from highest-impact-first to default:
    1. SINGLE_ISSUER | DEFER_TASKRUN | COOP_TASKRUN |
       TASKRUN_FLAG | SUBMIT_ALL  (>= 6.1, the optimal mix)
    2. COOP_TASKRUN | TASKRUN_FLAG | SUBMIT_ALL  (>= 5.19)
    3. SUBMIT_ALL  (>= 5.18)
    4. 0 (default; works on any 5.1+ kernel)

    Returns the first mask the kernel accepts via a no-op
    ``IoUringRing(entries)`` setup; closes the probe ring
    immediately. Called once per worker at bufring loop init.

    Args:
        entries: SQE count for the probe ring; tiny so the
            probe is cheap. Defaults to 64.

    Returns:
        Best-fit setup_flags mask, or 0 if no flag combination
        is accepted (kernel < 5.18 or io_uring unavailable).

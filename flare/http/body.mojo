"""Streaming response body primitives.

The ``Response.body: List[UInt8]`` field forces the entire
response body to materialise before the first ``send`` — a 100MB
download allocates 100MB per concurrent client, regardless of the
peer's read speed. This module promotes streaming bodies: the
reactor pulls chunks on writable edges so that:

- 100MB downloads cost a few KB of buffer per connection (one
  chunk in flight at a time).
- Server-Sent Events, file downloads, log tails, AI-token
  streaming — all the cases where the response body isn't bounded
  at handler-return time — work naturally without a separate API
  surface.
- Backpressure falls out of construction: when the peer is slow,
  the kernel send buffer fills, the reactor doesn't ask for the
  next chunk. No high-water marks needed.

Pieces in place:

- ``ChunkSource`` trait: anything that can produce one chunk of
  bytes per ``next(cancel)`` call.
- ``Body`` trait: anything that can be rendered as a sequence of
  byte chunks; declares ``content_length()`` (Optional, for
  setting the header) and ``next_chunk(cancel)``.
- ``InlineBody``: today's behaviour packaged as a ``Body`` impl
  — wraps a ``List[UInt8]`` and yields it as one chunk.
- ``ChunkedBody[Source: ChunkSource]``: adapter from a user
  ``ChunkSource`` to the ``Body`` trait.

Status (K1 landed):

- Streaming a ``Response`` through the normal ``Handler`` path on
  HTTP/1.1 works: ``Response.body_stream`` carries a
  ``ChunkSourceBox`` and the epoll reactor's chunked write loop
  (``flare/http/_reactor/conn_handle.mojo``) frames a bounded batch
  of chunks per writable edge -- the "100MB without 100MB
  allocation" path. Use ``stream_response(source)`` to build one.

Pieces still open:

- Making ``Response`` parametric over ``B: Body`` (so handlers can
  return ``Response[ChunkedBody[MySource]]``). Today's ``Response``
  keeps its concrete ``List[UInt8]`` body plus the optional
  ``body_stream``; ``ResponseImpl[B]`` exists as an additive
  authoring type, but migrating the hot-path alias is a follow-up.
- ``serve_streaming`` across multiple listeners (multi-worker works;
  ``bind_many`` extras do not).

``body_stream`` itself is served on every wire: HTTP/1.1 chunked,
HTTP/2 incremental DATA frames, HTTP/3 over QUIC, and the same h1
chunked framing as ciphertext once the reactor has terminated TLS.

The shape and public API of ``ChunkSource`` / ``Body`` /
``InlineBody`` / ``ChunkedBody`` are stable.

trait ChunkSource(Deinitable, Movable):
    """A source of byte chunks.

    Implementors yield successive chunks via ``next(cancel)``. The
    return has three meanings: a non-empty chunk is data, ``None`` is
    end-of-stream, and an **empty** chunk means "alive, but nothing
    right now". The ``cancel`` token lets long-running sources
    short-circuit when the client disconnects (peer FIN), the request
    times out, or the server drains.

    The reactor drains a bounded batch per writable edge rather than a
    single chunk, so a source that is merely idle must say so with an
    empty chunk instead of manufacturing filler: an empty chunk ends the
    batch and the connection retries on the next edge. Returning filler
    means the reactor emits a whole batch of it per edge.

    Implementors may own buffer state across calls (an SSE source
    might rewrite its internal buffer in place); the chunk
    returned must remain valid until the **next** call to
    ``next``.

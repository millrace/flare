"""Streaming response body primitives.

The ``Response.body: List[UInt8]`` field forces the entire
response body to materialise before the first ``send`` — a 100MB
download allocates 100MB per concurrent client, regardless of the
peer's read speed. Track 4 of design-0.5 promotes streaming bodies
into : the reactor pulls chunks on writable edges so that:

- 100MB downloads cost a few KB of buffer per connection (one
  chunk in flight at a time).
- Server-Sent Events, file downloads, log tails, AI-token
  streaming — all the cases where the response body isn't bounded
  at handler-return time — work naturally without a separate API
  surface.
- Backpressure falls out of construction: when the peer is slow,
  the kernel send buffer fills, the reactor doesn't ask for the
  next chunk. No high-water marks needed.

Pieces in place after this commit:

- ``ChunkSource`` trait: anything that can produce one chunk of
  bytes per ``next(cancel)`` call.
- ``Body`` trait: anything that can be rendered as a sequence of
  byte chunks; declares ``content_length()`` (Optional, for
  setting the header) and ``next_chunk(cancel)``.
- ``InlineBody``: today's behaviour packaged as a ``Body`` impl
  — wraps a ``List[UInt8]`` and yields it as one chunk.
- ``ChunkedBody[Source: ChunkSource]``: adapter from a user
  ``ChunkSource`` to the ``Body`` trait.

Pieces deferred (documented per-section):

- Making ``Response`` parametric over ``B: Body`` (so handlers
  can return ``Response[ChunkedBody[MySource]]``). Today's
  ``Response`` keeps its concrete ``List[UInt8]`` body field;
  user code that wants streaming uses ``ChunkSource`` directly
  with the reactor adoption that lands as a follow-up.
- The reactor's ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` write loop —
  pulls the next chunk on each writable edge. The piece that
  delivers the headline "100MB without 100MB allocation" lands
  with the reactor adoption.
- The SSE example (``examples/intermediate/sse.mojo``) demonstrates the
  ``ChunkSource`` + ``ChunkedBody`` shape against an in-process
  loop; the network-side demo follows the reactor adoption.

This split keeps the diff reviewable. The shape and public API
of ``ChunkSource`` / ``Body`` / ``InlineBody`` / ``ChunkedBody``
are stable from this commit forward; integration into
``Response`` and the reactor lands without breaking handlers.

Closes the trait portion of Track 4.

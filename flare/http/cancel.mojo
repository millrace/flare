"""Cancel token plumbed from the reactor into request handlers.

A handler runs to completion regardless of client behaviour. If the
    client TCP-disconnects mid-handler, the handler has no signal until
    the next ``_send`` returns ``EPIPE``. By then the handler has already
    done its expensive work (DB query, downstream HTTP fan-out, JSON
    serialisation).

the reactor allocates one ``CancelCell`` per
connection (heap-allocated ``Int``). ``Cancel`` is a thin handle the
reactor passes to a ``CancelHandler.serve(req, cancel)``; the handler
polls ``cancel.cancelled()`` between expensive steps and short-circuits
when True.

Cancellation is **cooperative**, not preemptive — Mojo can't preempt
synchronous code, and synchronous preemption would defeat the
reactor's per-thread invariant anyway. The contract is: the handler
checks the flag at boundaries it owns; the reactor sets it at one of:

- ``CancelReason.PEER_CLOSED`` — ``recv == 0`` (peer FIN) observed
  before the response was queued.
- ``CancelReason.TIMEOUT`` — a per-request, per-handler, or
  per-body-read deadline fired.
- ``CancelReason.SHUTDOWN`` — ``HttpServer.drain(timeout_ms)`` was
  called.

The default-initialised ``Cancel`` returned by ``Cancel.never()`` is a
sentinel that never fires; tests and synthetic ``CancelHandler`` calls
that don't have a real reactor cell behind them use it.

Implementation
--------------

A ``CancelCell`` heap-allocates a single ``Int`` and owns its
lifetime. ``Cancel`` carries the cell's address as an ``Int`` and
rebuilds a fresh ``UnsafePointer[Int, MutUntrackedOrigin]`` per access
— the same pattern the multicore ``Scheduler`` uses for the
``stopping`` flag, and the only one that survives Mojo's current
(current Mojo nightly) origin / aliasing model when passing the
cancel handle across function-call boundaries. Reads / writes go
through ``Atomic[DType.int64]`` acquire-load / release-store (the
cell can be flipped from a peer thread on shutdown), which lowers to
a plain ``mov`` on x86-64 (TSO) and to ``ldar`` / ``stlr`` on ARM64:

- Storing a typed ``UnsafePointer[Int, MutUntrackedOrigin]`` as a
  struct field in ``Cancel`` produces stale reads after the struct is
  passed through a function (verified empirically: reads at a
  numerically-correct address returned the pointer struct size,
  ``8``, instead of the live byte).
- An inline ``UInt8`` cell on the owning struct (instead of heap)
  does not have a stable address across the synchronous call chain
  the reactor builds, again per direct testing.

The combination here — heap allocation for cell stability + ``Int``
address in ``Cancel`` for transport stability — is the only one that
passes the test suite and the
``cell.flip(reason); h.serve(req^, cell.handle())`` round-trip.

Why ``Int`` instead of ``UInt8`` for the cell value: a byte-sized
heap cell hit the same aliasing failure as the typed-pointer field,
suggesting Mojo's aliasing model treats sub-word-aligned loads
through ``MutUntrackedOrigin`` differently than full-word loads. A
machine word avoids the path the bug appeared to depend on. The
cell is one cache line per connection — acceptable cost for the
cancel infrastructure.

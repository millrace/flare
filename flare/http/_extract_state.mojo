    ``State[T]`` is a no-op :trait:`Extractor`: its ``apply`` reads
    nothing from the request, so the value set when the handler
    prototype was registered survives ``Extracted[H]``'s per-request
    prototype copy. Use it for shared, request-independent state -- a
    DB pool, config, a cache handle -- next to the request-derived
    extractor fields. The direct analogue of axum's ``State(db)``.

    ``T`` must be ``Copyable & Defaultable & Movable`` (the same bound
    the enclosing handler struct needs). See :class:`Extracted` for a
    full registration example.

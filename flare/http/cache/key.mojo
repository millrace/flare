"""Cache key derivation (RFC 9111 §4 "Constructing Responses
from Caches").

A cache key uniquely identifies a stored response. The minimum
inputs are the request method + the effective request URI; the
``Vary`` response header expands this with selected request
headers so two requests to the same URI with different
``Accept-Language`` headers store separate entries.

This module produces a deterministic string key from those
inputs. The serialisation format is internal; consumers should
treat keys as opaque tokens. Concrete store implementations may
hash the key into a fixed-width identifier.

"""Happy-eyeballs HTTP/3-vs-HTTP/2 *connection* race.

When an ``https://`` request is eligible for HTTP/3 (``prefer_http3`` or a
fresh Alt-Svc advert) AND is idempotent, flare races the h3 (QUIC)
*connection establishment* against the proven h2/h1 (TLS) connect
*concurrently* on two OS threads instead of trying h3 first and falling
back sequentially. UDP is far more likely than TCP to be blocked by a
middlebox, so a dead h3 path must not add its dial timeout on top of the
h2 dial -- overlapping the two means the wall-clock cost is
``max(h3, h2)`` rather than ``h3_timeout + h2``. h3 is preferred
whenever it connects.

Design (mirrors :func:`flare.runtime.scheduler._worker_entry`):

* Each leg establishes *only the connection* for one protocol on its own
  thread via :func:`_race_worker`, which calls a caller-supplied
  connect function (``_ConnectFn``) and records success / failure into a
  heap-allocated :class:`_RaceResult` cell. The connect function is
  passed in (rather than this module importing ``HttpClient``) to avoid
  an import cycle. The h3 leg leaves its established connection in the
  client's QUIC pool so the subsequent request reuses it.
* :func:`race_http3_h2_connect` spawns both
  :class:`flare.runtime._thread.ThreadHandle` workers and ``join()``s
  both before reading any result. ``pthread_join`` is a happens-before
  barrier, so the result cells are read race-free with no atomics, and
  joining guarantees no worker outlives its handle (which the thread
  module documents as UB).
* Returns the winning protocol (:data:`RACE_H3` when the h3 connect
  succeeded, else :data:`RACE_H2` when the h2 connect succeeded, else
  :data:`RACE_NONE`). The caller then runs the request *once* on the
  winner -- the request itself is never duplicated.

This replaces the earlier whole-*request* race, which sent an idempotent
request on both wires (the server saw it twice). Racing only the connect
keeps the latency win while sending the request exactly once.

The h2/h1 leg probes reachability by establishing a TLS
connection; unless the HTTPS keep-alive pool is enabled (``with_pool``)
that probed connection is closed, so on the (rarer) h2-wins path the
real request re-dials TLS -- one redundant handshake. The h3 leg always
pools its connection, so the common h3-wins path does not re-dial.
Upgrade path: pool the probed h2/h1 connection unconditionally once the
TLS pool accepts h2 connections.
The join is bounded (not detached) -- each leg's own dial timeout caps
how long the slower leg holds up the return; the upgrade path is
``pthread_detach`` + an atomic refcount on the cell once the stdlib
ships an ``Atomic`` type.

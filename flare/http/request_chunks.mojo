"""Streaming-shape adapter for inbound request bodies.

The ``Request.body`` field is a ``List[UInt8]`` — the reactor
pre-buffers the entire request body before dispatching to the
handler. That works for the typical 1KB JSON / form POST, but
a 100MB upload allocates 100MB per concurrent client.

``RequestChunkSource`` lets handlers consume request bodies as
a sequence of bounded-size chunks, mirroring the ``ChunkSource``
shape used for outbound :class:`StreamingResponse` bodies.
The source pulls from the pre-buffered ``Request.body``, so the
peak memory the *server* holds is unchanged; what it bounds is
what the *handler* materializes at once.

Symmetric to ``StreamingResponse[B]`` (outbound):

- ``StreamingResponse[B: Body]`` lets the reactor pull response
  chunks on writable edges via ``B.next_chunk(cancel)``.
- ``RequestChunkSource`` lets handlers pull request chunks via
  ``ChunkSource.next(cancel)`` — same trait, opposite direction.

What this does and does not buy you:

- It bounds the *handler's* working set: a handler that loops
  ``next(cancel)`` never holds more than one chunk of its own,
  and polls cancellation between chunks, so a large upload bails
  immediately on client FIN / drain / deadline.
- It does **not** bound the *reactor's* working set. The body is
  already fully buffered by the time ``serve`` is called.

An earlier version of this note claimed reactor adoption would be
"a pure substitution at the ``Request`` constructor". That is not
true, and the reason is worth stating so nobody re-attempts it:
``Handler.serve(req) -> Response`` is synchronous and one-shot.
Feeding it a body that is still arriving means the handler must
block inside ``serve`` waiting for the socket, which stalls every
other keep-alive connection multiplexed onto that worker. Mojo has
no async to escape with.

Genuinely unbounded inbound therefore lives on the edge-driven
:trait:`flare.http.streaming_server.StreamHandler` path, where the
front is re-entered per readable edge and pulls with
``StreamConn.read_body()``. That is not a gap to be closed later;
it is the shape the constraint forces. See
``docs/architecture.md`` under "Two handler shapes".

Configuration:

- ``chunk_size`` defaults to 64 KiB — same chunk size the
  ``HttpServer`` uses for outbound writes, picked to fill an
  L1 cache line × 1024 (typical x86-64) without crossing into
  page-fault territory on a 4 KB page system.
- ``cancel_check_chunks`` defaults to 1 (poll cancel after
  every chunk). Power-of-two values let the implementation
  use a bit-mask for the modulo check.

    """A ``ChunkSource`` that yields successive slices of a
    request body as bounded-size chunks.

    Owns no state beyond the underlying ``List[UInt8]`` (held by
    the request that constructed this source — *do not outlive
    the source request*) and a few bookkeeping fields:

    - ``buf`` — owned copy of the request body bytes; cheap to
      construct (one ``List[UInt8]`` clone) and lets the source
      outlive the originating ``Request`` if the handler needs
      to.
    - ``cursor`` — byte offset of the next chunk within ``buf``.
    - ``chunk_size`` — max bytes per yielded chunk.
    - ``cancel_check_chunks`` — how often the source should
      poll the ``Cancel`` token; default is every chunk. Bumping
      this can shave the per-chunk cost on tight loops where
      cancellation latency tolerates a few-chunks delay.

    The trait contract says the chunk returned must remain
    valid until the next ``next`` call. This impl returns a
    freshly-allocated ``List[UInt8]`` per chunk (the slice is
    copied out of ``buf``), so callers can stash the chunk
    indefinitely if they want — no aliasing issues.

"""Server-side 0-RTT (EarlyData) support helpers.

Carved out of :mod:`flare.quic.server` so the 1974-line listener
stays under the 1k-line budget and the security-sensitive 0-RTT
admission logic lives in one auditable place.

0-RTT lets a resuming client send application data in its first
flight, before the handshake completes (RFC 9001 §4.1). The reward is
a saved round trip; the hazard is **replay**: an on-path attacker can
capture the encrypted 0-RTT flight and re-send it. flare keeps 0-RTT
OFF by default (``max_early_data_size == 0``); a deployment opts in
per-listener.

This module provides:

* :class:`EarlyDataReplayGuard` -- a per-connection anti-replay window
  (RFC 9000 §13.2-style sliding bitmask) plus an early-data byte
  budget. It rejects duplicate / too-old packet numbers and caps the
  accepted early bytes at the configured maximum.
* :class:`EarlyDataStrikeSet` -- a *listener-level* cross-connection
  anti-replay set keyed on the client-chosen DCID + a time window. It
  catches a captured first flight replayed against a *fresh*
  connection (after the original closed), which the per-connection
  guard cannot see.
* :func:`early_data_packet_len` -- length of a coalesced 0-RTT
  long-header packet, so the datagram-walk in the listener can step
  over / into a 0-RTT packet instead of bailing.

The two guards are layered. :class:`EarlyDataReplayGuard` is
*intra-connection* (a replay within one resumed connection, plus the
byte budget); :class:`EarlyDataStrikeSet` is *cross-connection* (the
same flight replayed as a new accept). The strike set is keyed on the
ODCID + a wall-clock window rather than an opaque session ticket --
rustls 0.23 cannot export single-use tickets (confirmed for this
project), so DCID+window is the achievable approximation. See
:class:`EarlyDataStrikeSet` for the exact ceiling.

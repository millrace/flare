"""``flare.quic.server`` -- QUIC server reactor.

Wraps the sans-I/O QUIC connection state machine
(:class:`flare.quic.state.Connection`) in a UDP listener +
per-connection dispatcher. The per-datagram dispatch loop
threads bytes through :class:`OpenSslQuicCrypto` packet
protection, the transport-frame parser, and
:meth:`Connection.handle_frame` to produce
:class:`ConnectionEvents` for the H3 driver above; idle
timers sit on the shared TimerWheel.

## What ships here

- :class:`QuicServerConfig` -- bind configuration: host, port,
  rustls config carrier, idle timeout, max packet size.
- :class:`QuicListener` -- factory that owns a bound UDP
  socket plus the per-connection dispatch table. The :meth:`bind`
  factory opens the socket, :meth:`tick` drains one datagram
  (unit-testable), :meth:`run` is the blocking event loop, and
  :meth:`shutdown` requests a clean exit.
- :class:`QuicConnection` -- per-connection driver that
  composes the existing :class:`flare.quic.state.Connection`
  state machine with the rustls QUIC session.
- :class:`ConnectionIdTable` -- per-listener routing table from
  Connection ID to connection slot, used by the dispatch loop
  to route inbound datagrams via the Destination Connection ID
  in the packet header (RFC 9000 §5.1).

References:
- RFC 9000 §5 "Connections" -- Connection ID routing.
- RFC 9000 §10 "Connection Termination" -- idle / draining.
- RFC 9000 §17 "Packet Formats" -- long / short header parse
  for the dispatch path.

# TODO(2026-08-31, track-quic-listener): this module is dominated by the
# single ``QuicListener`` struct (bind / tick / run / shutdown + the
# per-datagram dispatch loop). Mojo cannot split one struct's methods
# across files, so the file stays over the 1000-line bar; the value
# types (QuicServerConfig / QuicConnection / ConnectionIdTable) and pure
# helpers already moved to ``_server_types`` / ``_server_support``.
# Further shrinking needs the cold dispatch methods reworked into free
# functions. Allowlisted in tools/check_reactor_size.sh until then.

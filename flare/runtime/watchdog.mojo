"""Deadline watchdog: a background thread that flips Cancel cells on expiry.

Mojo cannot preempt synchronous code -- a handler that never yields
runs to completion on its worker no matter what. The reactor can only
observe a deadline at the points it owns (request-read edges, streaming
writable edges). To give a *time-based* deadline any teeth against a
handler that at least cooperatively polls its ``Cancel`` token, a
separate OS thread must watch the clock and flip the cell; the worker
thread is busy inside the handler and cannot watch its own deadline.

That is exactly what :struct:`DeadlineWatchdog` does (the K2 mechanism
the assessment names): one background thread polls a fixed table of
``(deadline_ms, cancel_cell_addr)`` slots and, when a slot's deadline
passes, writes ``CancelReason.TIMEOUT`` into that cell with a release
store -- the same cell + ordering :struct:`flare.http.cancel.CancelCell`
uses, so a ``CancelHandler`` polling ``cancel.cancelled()`` observes it.

This is cooperative, not true preemption: a handler that never checks
its cancel token is still not interruptible (a Mojo language limit, not
a design choice) -- for those, ``PostHocDeadline`` still refuses the
too-late response. What the watchdog adds is real mid-flight
cancellation for handlers that *do* cooperate, which the on-worker
reactor cannot deliver by itself.

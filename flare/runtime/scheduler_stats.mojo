"""Cross-thread stop flag and per-worker stats cell.

Shared by ``scheduler.mojo`` (which allocates and reads them) and
``_worker.mojo`` (which writes them), so they live here rather than in
either -- importing one from the other would be a cycle.

``scheduler.mojo`` re-exports every name below, so the existing
``from flare.runtime.scheduler import load_stop_flag`` call sites in
the reactor loops keep working unchanged.

# The stopping flag is a heap-allocated byte written by the main
# thread and read by every worker. Release-store / acquire-load pair
# gives the workers a proper happens-before edge on shutdown; lowers
# to a plain ``mov`` on x86-64 (TSO) and to ``stlr`` / ``ldar`` on
# ARM64. Callers pass the raw heap address (the same ``Int`` the
# worker ctx carries) so the flag stays valid across struct moves.

"""Per-worker, size-class-bucketed buffer pool.

Hands out and returns ``BufferHandle`` byte buffers from one of
four size classes (1 KiB / 4 KiB / 16 KiB / 64 KiB) so the
HTTP/1.1 reactor's read- and write-side temporaries don't pay
``alloc(N)`` / ``free(N)`` per request.

Background
----------

flare's reactor reads from each accepted socket into a
``List[UInt8]`` chunk buffer (``ServerConfig.read_buffer_size``,
default 8 KiB) per ``recv(2)`` call, and serialises every
response into a second contiguous ``List[UInt8]`` before the
``send(2)`` (or ``writev(2)`` via :mod:`flare.runtime.iovec`)
syscall. Both lists
are constructed-and-destructed once per request on the keep-alive
hot path. At realistic high-throughput targets (>200K req/s on
4 workers) that's ~1.7 M ``alloc + free`` pairs per second per
buffer side — glibc's malloc is fast but the cache-line eviction
it causes for every small allocation is not free.

The Rust analogues to look at:

* ``hyper`` keeps a per-connection 8 KiB read buffer that is
  reused for the lifetime of the connection (no realloc per
  request, no per-message-frame ``Vec::new``). The buffer is
  owned by the connection state, not pooled across connections.
* ``actix-web`` and ``axum`` (via ``hyper``) inherit the same
  shape; ``actix``'s framework adds a per-worker ``BytesMut``
  freelist for response builders.

``BufferPool`` picks the more conservative shape: a **per-worker pool
of fixed-size-class buffers** that is independent of any
connection. The reactor borrows a buffer for one request, fills
it, drains it, and returns it to the pool; the next request on
any connection (same worker) gets the same buffer back. No
cross-worker handoff, no atomic, no mutex — same per-worker
discipline as ``DateCache`` and ``ResponsePool``.

Size classes
------------

Four power-of-two classes pinned at:

* **1 KiB** — tiny payloads (most plaintext / health-check
  responses, the TFB plaintext target itself).
* **4 KiB** — typical JSON responses, typical HTTP/1.1 request
  headers + small body.
* **16 KiB** — moderate payloads (small file responses, a
  typical compressed-body buffer).
* **64 KiB** — large reads / writes (chunked-body single-chunk
  serialisation upper bound, large file-served responses).

The ``acquire(min_capacity)`` API takes a *minimum* capacity and
rounds up to the smallest size class that fits. Requests larger
than 64 KiB fall through to a one-off heap allocation that bypass
the pool — the buffer is destroyed on release rather than
recycled, so giant requests don't cause the pool to grow
unbounded.

What this module provides
-------------------------

* ``BufferHandle`` — the value moved in / out of the pool. Wraps
  a ``List[UInt8]`` plus an Int recording the size class so the
  matching pool bucket knows which class to push into on
  release. ``Movable`` (not ``Copyable``) for the same reason
  ``Response`` is.
* ``BufferPool`` — per-worker bucketed pool with the four size
  classes above. ``acquire(min_capacity) -> BufferHandle`` /
  ``release(var BufferHandle)`` shape. Each bucket is bounded
  at a small capacity (default 8 per class) so the pool's
  steady-state memory is at most ``8 * (1+4+16+64) KiB ≈
  680 KiB`` per worker.
* ``BufferPool.with_class_capacity(N)`` factory for tests and
  custom workloads.
* ``BufferPool.size_for(min_capacity) -> Int`` helper exposed
  publicly for callers that want to allocate without pooling
  but still snap to the canonical size classes (e.g. on the
  oversize fall-through path).

Storage strategy
----------------

Same as ``ResponsePool`` (B6): ``BufferHandle`` is ``Movable``
but not ``Copyable``, so each per-class bucket is a ``List[Int]``
of heap addresses managed via ``Pool[BufferHandle]``. ``acquire``
pops an address, takes the pointee, frees the cell.
``release`` moves the supplied handle into a fresh cell and
pushes the address. Net allocation cost: one ``Pool.alloc/free``
pair per acquire/release; the actual win is that the **underlying
``List[UInt8]`` capacity is preserved** across the move-in / out.

Wiring into the reactor's accept-and-read path is a follow-up;
this module provides the primitive + tests + re-exports.

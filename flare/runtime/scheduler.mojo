"""Multicore scheduler: 1 shared listener, N reactors, N pthread workers.

Runs N single-threaded reactor loops in parallel, one per pthread,
all sharing a *single* listener fd. Each worker registers the
listener fd in its own reactor with ``EPOLLEXCLUSIVE`` (on Linux
>= 4.5) so the kernel wakes exactly one worker per accept event.
On macOS / kqueue the flag is unavailable and registration falls
back to plain ``register`` — the practical behaviour is similar
because non-blocking ``accept`` returns ``EAGAIN`` on the losers.

This is the redesign of the multicore path. the prior implementation
used N independent listeners bound with ``SO_REUSEPORT``; the
kernel then distributed accepted connections across workers by
hashing each connection's 4-tuple to one of the N listeners. That
scheme has a known fairness gap under bursty arrival: a
256-connection storm from a wrk2-style load generator can land
80+ conns on one worker and 30 on another, producing
hundreds-of-millisecond head-of-line tail latency on the
overloaded worker(s). ``benchmark/configs/throughput_mc``
shows the failure mode at p99 ≈ 1.7 s; the
``EPOLLEXCLUSIVE``-based shared-listener design collapses the
same workload's p99 to the millisecond range.

Shutdown path: ``shutdown()`` flips a heap-allocated ``Bool`` that
every worker polls on each reactor iteration. A stable heap address
is used (instead of a field on the ``Scheduler`` struct) so the flag
survives the NRVO-or-not move from ``Scheduler.start`` back to the
caller. The main thread then closes the shared listener fd once
and joins all workers before ``shutdown()`` returns.

Relying on ``close(listener_fd)`` alone to wake the workers is not
enough on Linux: when the fd is also registered in the worker's
``epoll`` instance, the kernel holds an extra reference to the
underlying ``struct file``, so ``close()`` from another thread does
not trigger an ``EPOLLHUP`` and the workers stay blocked in
``epoll_wait`` until the 100 ms poll timeout fires. The heap flag is
what actually breaks the loop.

This module is :trait:`Frontend`-generic: every worker calls
:meth:`Frontend.run_worker` once with its assigned listener fd
and the shared stopping flag. The frontend value is moved
(per-worker copies are made via ``F.copy()``; if that's expensive
users should wrap their handler's expensive state behind an
``UnsafePointer`` or a similar shared-reference holder).

The scheduler used to import directly from
:mod:`flare.http._server_reactor_impl`,
:mod:`flare.http._unified_reactor_impl`,
:mod:`flare.http.handler`, :mod:`flare.http.server`,
:mod:`flare.http.static_response`, and :mod:`flare.http2.server`.
That layering violation (runtime depending on protocol modules)
is gone now; the scheduler depends only on the
:trait:`flare.runtime.Frontend` trait and concrete impls live
where their protocol does
(:class:`flare.http.HttpFrontend` /
:class:`flare.http.StaticHttpFrontend`).

Known limitations:

- The stopping flag is a heap-allocated byte written from the main
  thread and read from each worker through ``Atomic[DType.uint8]``
  release-store / acquire-load (``store_stop_flag`` /
  ``load_stop_flag``). This gives the workers a proper happens-before
  edge on shutdown and lowers to a plain ``mov`` on x86-64 (TSO) and
  to ``stlr`` / ``ldar`` on ARM64. The per-iteration re-materialisation
  of the pointer inside the frontend's serving loop still defeats the
  optimiser's LICM so every iteration re-reads the flag.
- Worker panics that escape :meth:`Frontend.run_worker` are caught and
  discarded in ``_worker_entry`` because pthread has no exception
  channel. ``is_running()`` still reports ``True`` until the
  ``ThreadHandle`` is joined, which is a mildly wrong signal for a
  worker that crashed rather than shut down cleanly. Plumbing a
  per-worker error cell back to the Scheduler is also scheduled for a future release.

        Broadcasts the stopping flag to every worker, closes every
        worker's listener socket, waits up to ``timeout_ms`` for
        workers to drain in-flight work, then joins. Returns one
        ``ShutdownReport`` per worker — best-effort counts based on
        whether the worker joined inside the timeout.

        Each worker publishes its live-connection count to a shared
        per-worker stats cell on every reactor iteration (release
        store), so once the worker joins the Scheduler reads a real
        ``in_flight_at_deadline`` (acquire load) instead of the old
        fabricated 0 / 1. Those remaining connections are force-closed
        during the worker's graceful-shutdown pass, so ``timed_out``
        mirrors that count. ``drained`` stays a coarse budget signal
        (1 when a positive drain budget was given, 0 on a hard cut):
        the reactor does not count naturally-completed connections, so
        an exact "finished vs cut" split is not available in this
        force-close model.

        ``timeout_ms <= 0`` is a hard stop (equivalent to
        ``shutdown()`` with the documented hard-cut semantics).
        Negative values are clamped to 0.

            timeout_ms: Max ms to wait for the workers to drain.

        Returns:
            ``List[ShutdownReport]`` of length ``num_workers`` (the
            count at start time). ``in_flight_at_deadline`` /
            ``timed_out`` are the real per-worker live-connection

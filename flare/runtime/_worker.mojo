"""Per-worker context and pthread entry point for the scheduler.

Split out of ``scheduler.mojo`` when that file crossed the 1000-line
reactor-size budget. The seam is a real one rather than a line count:
``_WorkerCtx`` and ``_worker_entry`` are the boundary between the
scheduler (which owns listeners, threads and lifecycle) and one
worker's execution, and neither touches ``Scheduler`` internals.

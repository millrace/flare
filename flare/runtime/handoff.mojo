"""Cross-worker connection handoff.

A small mutex-guarded MPSC FIFO designed for one specific job:
moving a freshly-accepted file descriptor (or any opaque integer
token) between flare's per-worker reactors so the scheduler can
even out load skew without paying for kernel-level fd migration.

## Why this exists

flare's multicore mode (``HttpServer.serve(... num_workers=N)``)
leans on Linux's ``SO_REUSEPORT`` for accept distribution. The
kernel's ``SO_REUSEPORT`` hash spreads new connections across the
listening sockets of the N workers, but the distribution is
*static per 4-tuple*: keep-alive traffic from a small client pool
can land disproportionately on one worker. The
``benchmark/results//multicore`` run logs P99.9 tails ~0.5×
worse on one worker compared to its three siblings under skewed
keep-alive — see the design doc for numbers.

## What it is

:class:`HandoffQueue` is a *bounded MPSC* FIFO of opaque ``Int``
slots (file descriptors or scheduler tokens). One owning thread
(the worker) calls :meth:`pop` to drain the queue under its own
reactor lock; any number of producer threads (peer workers
considering a steal) call :meth:`push`. The queue refuses pushes
when full and reports back so the producer can fall back to its
own accept path rather than block.

Single-producer / single-consumer is the common case (the peer
reactor that accepted the connection vs. the local reactor that
will own its lifetime), but the implementation tolerates multiple
producers via a ``pthread_mutex_t``.

## What it isn't

This is **not** a kernel fd migration: the receiving worker still
has to register the fd with its own ``epoll`` / ``kqueue``. We
keep the handoff at the *application* level so the implementation
is portable, tiny, and matches flare's "shared-nothing per worker"
discipline — every worker's reactor still owns its own fd set, the
handoff just changes *which* worker owns a brand-new fd.

The locked design adds a single uncontended atomic acquire on the
hot path (push). Under load the contention point is the producer
side, and benchmarks below show <50ns added per accept on a
modern x86 box, which is comfortably below the cost of the
syscall it amortises.

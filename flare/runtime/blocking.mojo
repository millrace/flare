"""Blocking-escape hatch: ``block_in_pool``.

The reactor's hot path is single-threaded per worker; any
blocking syscall (synchronous DB query, libc ``getaddrinfo``,
file I/O on a slow disk, CPU-heavy compute) freezes the worker
for the duration. The fix is to offload the blocking work to a
fresh kernel thread:

    var rows = block_in_pool[List[Row]](
        lambda: db.query("SELECT ..."),
        cancel,
    )

The handler stays in straight-line code; ``cancel`` short-
circuits if the request is cancelled mid-blocking-call.

Implementation: per-call detached pthread.

Each ``block_in_pool[T]`` call spawns a fresh kernel thread via
``pthread_create``, runs ``work()`` on it, and surfaces the
result back through a heap-allocated task struct. The submitter
(the reactor-thread handler) polls a ``done_flag`` in a 1 ms
sleep loop, also polling ``cancel`` so a flip surfaces
immediately.

Why per-call rather than a singleton pool:

1. Mojo's nightly does not allow module-level mutable ``var``s
   (``error: global variables are not supported``) — verified
   on the pinned nightly. Without that, a process-global pool
   needs either a libc mmap-backed flag-byte indirection or an
   API change that threads pool-state through every call site.
2. Per-call ``pthread_create`` overhead is ~30-50 µs on Linux
   x86_64. The API targets millisecond-scale blocking work
   (DB queries, disk I/O); the overhead is < 5 % of any
   workload that needs ``block_in_pool`` in the first place.
3. The MAX_POOL_SIZE cap (32) exposed in the public API still
   matters: callers that create pools-of-pools (e.g. fan-out
   query patterns) can use it to bound concurrent kernel
   threads. The library does not enforce it on the per-call
   shape because the natural place to enforce it is the
   caller's own admission control.

What the kernel-thread split actually buys:

- Blocking syscalls inside ``work()`` only block the work's
  pthread, not the reactor's pthread structure. The kernel can
  schedule other reactor workers onto the freed CPU while the
  syscall is waiting.
- A crash in ``work()`` (segfault, abort) kills its own pthread,
  not the reactor's; the submitter sees ``pthread_join`` return
  non-zero or ``done_flag`` never flipping (caught by an outer
  timeout if the user wires one in).
- Multi-worker parallelism: N concurrent connections on N
  reactor workers each calling ``block_in_pool`` get N parallel
  ``work()`` executions on N pthreads, instead of being
  serialised inside each reactor worker's thread.

What it does NOT buy (and why):

- The submitter (handler) thread is still blocked while
  ``work()`` runs. The synchronous public signature
  ``def block_in_pool[T](work, cancel) raises -> T`` requires
  this — to release the reactor's connection-loop while
  ``work()`` is in flight we'd need either Mojo async or a
  new "park this connection" reactor state. Both are
  release-line follow-ups.

Cancel contract (unchanged from the in-thread fallback):

- **Pre-flight:** if ``cancel`` is already flipped at entry,
  raise immediately without spawning anything.
- **In-flight:** the user's ``work()`` is responsible for
  polling ``cancel`` if it wants to short-circuit mid-call
  (the work runs on a kernel thread that can read the cancel
  cell directly). The library cannot preempt — Mojo doesn't
  expose preemption and pthread cancellation is unsafe under
  the borrow checker.
- **Post-flight:** the submitter blocks on ``pthread_join``
  until ``work()`` returns; on join it checks the cancel cell
  one more time. If the cell flipped while ``work()`` ran,
  raise with a "cancelled mid-flight (<reason>)" message
  instead of returning a now-stale result.

Why pthread_join rather than poll-on-done-flag:

A previous iteration of this implementation polled a heap
``done_flag`` byte with a 1 ms ``libc_usleep`` between checks
to surface mid-flight cancel without waiting for ``work()``
to complete. On the pinned Mojo nightly, ``libc_usleep`` hits
the documented 1000-1500x multiplier when the calling thread
participates in multi-threaded contexts (and a ``block_in_pool``
caller is, by construction, multi-threaded — the worker pthread
exists). That made the 1 ms poll behave like a 1 second poll
and dragged the per-call latency from ~50 µs to ~1.1 s. Joining
on the worker thread sidesteps the libc-time path entirely and
restores per-call latency to the pthread create + work + join
cost.

The trade-off is that mid-flight cancel no longer raises
*before* ``work()`` returns; it raises *after*. Handlers that
care about fast-cancel during long work can poll ``cancel``
inside ``work()``.

"""Provided-buffer-ring memory helpers for :mod:`flare.runtime.uring_reactor`.

Page-aligned anonymous mmap allocation (``_mmap_anon_rw`` / ``_munmap``)
for the kernel-shared ``IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING`` ring, plus the
byte-level ``struct io_uring_buf`` accessors (``_pbuf_ring_add`` /
``_pbuf_ring_get_tail`` / ``_pbuf_ring_set_tail``) that publish buffers
to the kernel with the correct acquire/release ordering. Split out of
``uring_reactor.mojo`` to keep that module within the file-size budget;
``uring_reactor`` re-exports every name so existing
``from flare.runtime.uring_reactor import _pbuf_ring_add`` (server
reactor, tests) call sites keep resolving unchanged.

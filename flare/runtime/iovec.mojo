"""``writev(2)`` vectored-I/O primitive.

Provides ``IoVecBuf`` — a typed wrapper around a heap-allocated
``struct iovec[]`` array — and the high-level ``writev_buf_all``
helper that loops over partial writes until every byte across
every vector has been sent.

Background
----------

flare's HTTP/1.1 response serializer today copies the status
line + every header + the body into a single contiguous
``List[UInt8]`` and calls ``send(2)`` once. The ``memcpy`` of
the body into that intermediate buffer is the dominant
allocation + copy cost on every response — for a 1 KiB body
that's a 1 KiB ``memcpy`` per request that doesn't actually
need to move bytes (the body is already in some other
``List[UInt8]`` owned by the handler).

``writev(2)`` lets the kernel scatter-gather a list of
``iovec`` cells (each a ``{ ptr, len }`` pair) into one TCP
segment without touching the body bytes from userspace. For
the same 1 KiB body case, the response serializer can pass:

* iovec[0] = status line bytes (≤ ~30 B)
* iovec[1] = header block bytes (~100-500 B)
* iovec[2] = body bytes (untouched, borrowed)

…and skip the ``memcpy``. On a workload where the body is
already a long-lived ``List[UInt8]`` (any handler that returns
a precomputed payload), this is a strict win.

This is the same approach hyper / actix-web / axum take at the
H1 layer: hyper's ``h1::role::Server::encode`` builds an
``EncodedBuf`` of multiple slices and passes them to
``Tokio``'s ``write_vectored`` (which is ``writev`` on
epoll/kqueue, ``WSASend`` on IOCP).

What this module provides (only the primitive)
----------------------------------------------

* ``IoVecBuf(n)`` — allocates a heap region of
  ``n * sizeof(struct iovec)`` bytes (16 B per cell on every
  64-bit Linux / macOS target). Callers populate cells via
  ``set(i, ptr, len)``.
* ``IoVecBuf.size_for(n) -> Int`` — exposes the byte-count
  computation for callers that want to ``stack_allocation`` an
  iovec array themselves.
* ``writev_buf(fd, iov_base, iovcnt) -> Int`` — single
  ``writev(2)`` call with EINTR retry. Returns bytes written
  on success; raises on EAGAIN / EPIPE / etc. (matches
  ``TcpStream.write`` semantics).
* ``writev_buf_all(fd, iov_base, iovcnt, total_bytes)`` —
  loops over partial writes by advancing through the iovec
  list until every byte across every cell is written. Updates
  the iovec cells in-place (advances ``iov_base[i].iov_base``
  / shrinks ``iov_base[i].iov_len`` for cells that were
  partially written).

Wiring into the HTTP/1.1 response serializer is a follow-up
commit that bolts onto this primitive without changing the
response struct's hot-path layout. The primitive exists today
so the wiring change is mechanical.

iovec layout
------------

On every supported target (64-bit Linux + macOS), the C
``struct iovec`` is 16 bytes::

    struct iovec {
        void  *iov_base;  // 8 bytes
        size_t iov_len;   // 8 bytes
    };

This module models the array as a flat ``UnsafePointer[UInt8]``
buffer of ``n * 16`` bytes, with ``set(i, ptr, len)`` writing
the two 8-byte words at the right offset. Reading the buffer
back via ``writev(2)`` gets the layout the kernel expects.

"""``io_uring`` SQE encoder + CQE decoder primitives.

Sits on top of :mod:`flare.runtime.io_uring` (which ships the
syscall FFI + ``IoUringRing`` setup/teardown). This module adds
the **submission queue entry** + **completion queue entry** byte-
level codec, plus the small set of prep helpers (``prep_nop``,
``prep_accept``, ``prep_recv``, ``prep_send``, ``prep_writev``,
``prep_close``, ``prep_async_cancel``) that the upcoming
``UringReactor`` (next commit) will call to fill SQE slots before
``io_uring_enter`` is invoked.

What this commit ships
----------------------

* **Opcode constants** (``IORING_OP_NOP``, ``IORING_OP_ACCEPT``,
  ``IORING_OP_RECV``, ``IORING_OP_SEND``, ``IORING_OP_WRITEV``,
  ``IORING_OP_CLOSE``, ``IORING_OP_ASYNC_CANCEL``,
  ``IORING_OP_RECVMSG``, ``IORING_OP_SENDMSG``,
  ``IORING_OP_READ_FIXED``, ``IORING_OP_WRITE_FIXED``,
  ``IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS``, ``IORING_OP_REMOVE_BUFFERS``).
* **SQE flag constants** (``IOSQE_FIXED_FILE``, ``IOSQE_IO_LINK``,
  ``IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK``, ``IOSQE_ASYNC``,
  ``IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT``, ``IOSQE_CQE_SKIP_SUCCESS``).
* **Multishot accept/recv flags** (``IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT``,
  ``IORING_ACCEPT_MULTISHOT``, ``IORING_FEAT_*``).
* **CQE flag constants** (``IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER``,
  ``IORING_CQE_F_MORE``, ``IORING_CQE_F_SOCK_NONEMPTY``).
* **``IoUringSqe``** — 64-byte SQE byte-buffer wrapper with
  byte-precise field accessors that mirror the kernel ABI
  (``include/uapi/linux/io_uring.h``). Construction zeros the
  whole 64 bytes; ``prep_*`` helpers fill the relevant fields.
* **``IoUringCqe``** — 16-byte CQE byte-buffer wrapper with
  ``user_data() / res() / flags()`` accessors.
* **Codec invariants** asserted under ``-D ASSERT=safe`` per
  the ``.cursor/rules/sanitizers-and-bounds-checking.mdc``
  guide: pointer non-NULL on construction, opcode in the
  documented range, fd ≥ 0 on prep_* helpers that take an fd.

Why a byte buffer instead of ``@fieldwise_init`` struct
-------------------------------------------------------

The kernel SQE has tagged unions (``addr2`` overlays
``cmd_op``, ``op_flags`` overlays ``msg_flags``/``rw_flags``/
``poll_events``/``sync_range_flags``/``timeout_flags`` etc.).
Modelling that as a single Mojo struct either requires a giant
``@fieldwise_init`` with overloaded interpretations per opcode
(error-prone — the same byte means different things per op) or
a tagged-union pattern Mojo doesn't yet have at the same
ergonomic level as Rust's ``union {}``.

The byte-buffer + field accessors approach mirrors how
``liburing``'s public API actually feels — ``io_uring_prep_recv``
writes specific bytes; the kernel reads them via fixed offsets.
flare's prep helpers do the same, modelling each opcode's
field interpretation explicitly at the prep call site, which
also documents which union arm we're using.

Bounds checking
---------------

All field accessors and prep helpers assert:

1. The buffer pointer is non-NULL (``buf != UnsafePointer()``).
2. Reads / writes stay inside the 64-byte SQE / 16-byte CQE
   window (``offset + width <= 64`` / ``<= 16``).
3. Opcodes stay within the documented kernel set.

These are ``debug_assert[assert_mode="safe"]`` calls, so they
compile in under ``-D ASSERT=safe`` (flare's default build
profile) and disappear under release-mode ``-D ASSERT=none``.
The full assertion battery (including loop invariants) is
exercised by ``pixi run tests-asserts-all``.

# v0.5.0 / S3.7 — extended tier of the soak harness.
#
# Runs all four workloads back-to-back at 300 s/workload (~15 min
# total). Stronger RSS-trend signal than the 60 s smoke; cheap
# enough to run on demand before pushing larger changes, but still
# below the 24 h release-gate threshold.
#
# Uses the same per-workload driver and the same gate definitions
# as the smoke + release-gate tiers. Only the duration knob
# differs.

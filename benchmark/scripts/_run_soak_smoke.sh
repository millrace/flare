# v0.5.0 / S3.7 — smoke tier of the soak harness.
#
# Runs all four workloads back-to-back at 60 s/workload (~3 min
# total) and prints a one-line PASS/FAIL summary per workload at
# the end. Designed to be cheap enough for PR CI / iterative dev.
#
# The 60 s window evaluates every gate the 24 h release-gate run
# evaluates (zero non-2xx, RSS within 2x of cold-start, fd_count
# bounded). The "RSS flat after 1 hour" signal lives only in the
# release-gate run; smoke only catches the loud failures.
#
# See docs/soak.md and design-v0.5 §6.5 for the full gate
# definitions and the three-tier model.

"""Tests for ``HttpServer.drain`` and ``ShutdownReport``.

``HttpServer.close()`` is a hard stop that cuts in-flight handlers
mid-write; ``HttpServer.drain(timeout_ms) -> ShutdownReport`` is the
recommended graceful shutdown.

Covers:

- ``ShutdownReport`` is a value type with the documented four fields
  and a working constructor.
- ``HttpServer.drain(0)`` is a hard stop equivalent to ``close()``:
  ``_stopping`` becomes ``True`` and the listener closes.
- ``HttpServer.drain(timeout_ms > 0)`` returns a report with
  non-negative counts.
- A negative ``timeout_ms`` is clamped to ``0``.
- Re-exports from ``flare.http`` and the root ``flare`` package
  resolve.
- The unified reactor's shutdown tail flips ``Cancel.SHUTDOWN`` on
  live connections before closing them, and reports how many were
  still in flight.

    """The unified reactor's shutdown tail reports what it closed.

    The legacy epoll loop always flipped ``Cancel.SHUTDOWN`` on live
    connections at shutdown; the unified loop that ``serve()`` actually
    runs used to free them outright, so a cancel-aware handler or a
    streaming body got the socket pulled mid-chunk with no signal. The
    tail now flips first and returns the live count.

    The flip itself is not asserted here: the same call frees the
    handle, and ``CancelCell.__del__`` frees the cell, so reading the
    ``Cancel`` afterwards would be a use-after-free. That
    ``signal_drain`` flips every stream cell is covered directly by
    tests/http2/test_h2_per_stream_cancel.mojo; this pins the count
    and the table teardown, which are what the caller observes.

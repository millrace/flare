"""Closure-shape + send-discipline contract tests.

Pins the surface area of what callable shapes flare's public API
accepts today, so a future Mojo release that lifts the
capturing-closure runtime-materialisation block can be detected
by the same test file (the additional shapes will start
compiling).

The contract documented in :doc:`docs/concurrency.md` and pinned
here:

1. ``def(...) raises thin -> ...`` — top-level / nested functions
   with no captures. Materialise as runtime values; bind into
   ``def(...) raises thin -> ...`` and ``FnHandler`` slots.
2. ``H: Handler & Copyable & Movable`` structs — first-class
   handler shape; compose by struct wrapping
   (``Logger[Inner]`` / ``WithCancel[H]`` / ...).
3. ``FnHandlerCT[F]`` with ``F: def(Request) raises thin -> Response``
   as a comptime parameter — zero-size, monomorphised; the existing
   v0.6 zero-overhead pattern.
4. ``block_in_pool[T](work, cancel)`` accepts only
   ``work: def() raises thin -> T`` — by construction, the closure
   has no captures. State shared with the pthread worker travels
   through heap-allocated structs whose addresses are read on the
   worker side. See ``flare/runtime/blocking.mojo``.

The capturing-closure / unified-closure runtime path is documented
as Mojo-blocked in ``.cursor/rules/development.mdc`` § Mojo-blocked
items remaining; the re-probe target is "drop the manually-tracked
shape table here once the compiler accepts the additional shapes".

# ── Negative-shape contract: documented Mojo-blocked path ───────────────────
#
# These are the shapes that DO NOT compile on Mojo
# and are documented in ``.cursor/rules/development.mdc`` §
# Mojo-blocked items remaining. We do not try to compile them in this
# file; the test module itself is the documentation that we attempted
# them via probe and they failed.
#
# 1. Capturing closure as runtime value:
#       var multiplier = 7
#       def scale(x: Int) raises -> Int:
#           return x * multiplier
#       FnHandler-style runtime slot binding fails with:
#         "TODO: capturing closures cannot be materialized as runtime values"
#
# 2. Body-block capture syntax (speculative future shape):
#       def scale(x: Int) -> Int { var multiplier }: ...
#       Fails to parse: "expected ':' in function definition".
#
# 3. unified declaration site:
#       def f(x: Int) raises unified -> Int: ...
#       Fails: "use of unknown declaration 'unified'".
#
# 4. Comptime-parametric capturing as Handler trait member:
#       struct CapturingCT[F: def(Int) raises capturing -> Int](Handler):
#           def serve(self, x: Int) raises -> Int:
#               return Self.F(x)
#       The call to ``Self.F(x)`` silently promotes ``serve`` to
#       ``capturing``, which can't satisfy the trait's plain ``serve``
#       signature.
#
# As Mojo evolves, re-probe each of the four shapes above and add
# the now-passing ones as positive tests here.

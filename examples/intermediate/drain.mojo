"""Example 23: Graceful shutdown with ``HttpServer.drain``.

``HttpServer.close()`` is a hard stop that cuts in-flight handlers
mid-write. ``HttpServer.drain(timeout_ms)`` closes the listener (no new
connections accepted), then lets the reactor flip
``CancelReason.SHUTDOWN`` on every live connection before closing it --
so cancel-aware handlers and streaming bodies observe the shutdown at
their next poll instead of losing the socket mid-chunk.

**flare installs no signal handler.** Mojo has no module-level mutable
state, which is what an async-signal-safe handler needs to flip a
process-global flag, so the caller owns the ``signal(2)`` wiring:

    var srv = HttpServer.bind(...)
    # ... your platform's signal-flagging mechanism sets a flag ...
    var report = srv.drain(timeout_ms=30_000)

On the counts: the single-threaded path returns zeros, because
``serve()`` owns the calling thread and ``drain`` can only signal the
loop and return -- it has no vantage point from which to count
anything. ``Scheduler.drain`` (multi-worker) joins its workers and
reports measured per-worker numbers.

Run:
    pixi run example-drain

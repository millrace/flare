"""Example 24 -- Server-Sent Events via the K1 streaming path.

Server-Sent Events is the canonical "the body isn't bounded at
handler-return time" case: the server emits ``data: ...\\n\\n`` records
until the client disconnects. Building SSE on ``Response.body:
List[UInt8]`` would force the handler to materialize the whole stream up
front, defeating the point.

Flare ships SSE as a first-class :class:`ChunkSource`
(:class:`SseChannel`) plus the :func:`stream_sse_response` helper. A
normal ``Handler`` / ``Router`` returns::

    def events(req: Request) raises -> Response:
        var ch = SseChannel()
        ch.push(SseEvent.message("hello"))
        ch.close()                      # or keep open for a live stream
        return stream_sse_response(ch^)

and the reactor drains the buffered SSE records on each writable edge --
over HTTP/1.1 (chunked transfer-encoding) and HTTP/2 (DATA frames) with
no SSE-specific reactor code. Backpressure is implicit (when the kernel
send buffer fills, the reactor stops calling ``next``); cancellation is
cooperative (``cancel.cancelled()`` ends the source).

This example drives an :class:`SseChannel` through the in-process
``drain`` helper so the demo is self-contained and deterministic; the
same channel plugs straight into ``stream_sse_response`` on a live
server (see ``tests/http/test_sse.mojo`` for the forked e2e).

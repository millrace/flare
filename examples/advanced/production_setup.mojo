"""Example: production-shaped HTTP server.

The thinnest "you could put this in front of users today"
shape. Stacks the four pieces docs/operations.md asks for:

  RequestId  -> per-request id injected into every log line.
  StructuredLogger -> one JSON object per response on stdout.
  CatchPanic -> turns a handler raise into a sanitised 500.
  /healthz   -> the contract your LB / k8s probe expects.

Plus an explicit graceful-shutdown handler ready to wire up to
SIGTERM. flare installs **no** signal handler -- Mojo has no
module-level mutable state for an async-signal-safe one, so the
caller owns the ``signal(2)`` wiring and calls ``srv.drain(...)``.
The example demonstrates the in-handler ``Cancel`` plumbing so
long-running handlers stop politely when drain flips the cell.

Pure construction -- no live network. The handler stack and the
server config are exercised at import + ``main()`` time so the
example runs in ``pixi run example-production-setup``.

Run:
    pixi run example-production-setup

"""Example -- HTTPS server with streaming, on the unified reactor.

`basic/tls.mojo` shows the TLS *client*; this is the server side. Flare
terminates TLS in-process and serves ordinary `Handler` / `Router` code
over the encrypted connection -- no reverse proxy required. The canonical
shape is one call to bind, one to serve::

    var srv = HttpServer.bind_tls(
        SocketAddr.localhost(8443),
        cert_file="server.crt",
        key_file="server.key",
        alpn=["h2", "http/1.1"],
    )
    srv.serve_tls(router^, num_workers=4)

`bind_tls` loads the PEM cert/key into a server `SSL_CTX` and advertises
the given ALPN protocols. `serve_tls` is `serve` on a TLS-bound server:
the handshake runs on the reactor as its own connection kind, so many
TLS connections are in flight at once and `num_workers > 1` spreads them
across cores. When the handshake completes, the negotiated ALPN picks
the protocol -- `h2` gets an HTTP/2 connection, anything else gets
HTTP/1.1 -- and from there it is the same parsing and serialisation the
plaintext path uses, just through `SSL_read` / `SSL_write`.

Streaming composes for free: a handler that returns `stream_response(src)`
is emitted with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` framing, pulled chunk by
chunk and written as ciphertext. The same handler streams byte-identically
on h1 (chunked), h2 (DATA frames), h3 (DATA frames), and https (chunked
over `SSL_write`) -- the wire is an implementation detail.

This demo is self-contained: it exercises the handler + streaming source
in-process (deterministic output), then binds a real HTTPS listener on an
ephemeral port using the repo's test cert to prove `bind_tls` loads the
cert and binds the socket. It does not enter the serve loop, which blocks.
